# Card Game

Welcome to the Game of Wonders - a simple card game implemented in Python!

## Introduction

This Python project implements a card game with the following classes:

### Card

Represents an individual playing card with a number and a shape.

### Player

Represents a player in the card game, with attributes for name, rounds won, and an array to store their cards.

### Game

Handles the overall game logic, including deck generation, card distribution, round calculations, and determining the game winner.

## How to Play

1. Players are prompted to enter their names.
2. The deck is shuffled and cards are distributed to each player.
3. Each round is played, and the winner of each round is determined based on card values.
4. The game winner is determined by the player who wins the most rounds.
